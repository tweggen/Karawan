# The story

## Story

### Activities

- Bring things from A to B.
- Carry persons from A to B (problem: Person visibility)

### Unsorted idea

We are in a computer anyway, so everybody is an avatar, that's why we see no persons
at all.

Between two cities, there are groves above which intercity trains hover.

be collected, but only once.
