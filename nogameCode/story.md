# The story

## Story

### Activities

- Bring things from A to B.
- Carry persons from A to B (problem: Person visibility)
- recharge at the polytopes.

### Unsorted ideas

We are in a computer anyway, so everybody is an avatar, that's why we see no persons
at all.

## Things

### Intercities

Between two cities, there are groves above which intercity trains hover.

### Polytopes

In segments of cities, you can find polytopes. Polytopes repair your hover. They can
be collected, but only once.
As we see, polytopes emit small cubes. What's the meaning behind this?

### Cubes

They seem to be remnants of a previous, highly advanced culture. They sound so beautiful
and peaciful if you - well, what do you do? Consume them? Do they consume you? Eventually,
it feels good to meet them.

And, there are purple cubes in the void area outside.

## People

### You

You are a nameless driver in a hover car that finds himself in a city.

### Agent 12

## Groups

This is your early buddy, your tutorial person. Someone that is introduced that
you know him.

### The Fishmongers

Introduced to be a household name, with sinister associations.
This now is a kind of a 7/11, a 24/7 convenience store. They are said to trade a 
lot more.

### someone

They started out by selling games to play if you are on the go. They are seriously
addictive, meeting the peoples' need for repetitive tasks and empty minds while
rushing to their works on uppers.

### Plent-o-matic (loanworking)

The mass employer advertising everywhere.

## Environment

We observe a day night cycle that never gets really bright.

### Food

Ramen is mentioned.

### Sprouce (Lemonade)

You see advertisement for a lemonade everywhere.
