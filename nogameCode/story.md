# The story

## Story

### Activities

- Bring things from A to B.
- Carry persons from A to B (problem: Person visibility)
- recharge at the polytopes.

### Unsorted ideas

We are in a computer anyway, so everybody is an avatar, that's why we see no persons
at all.

## Things

### Intercities

Between two cities, there are groves above which intercity trains hover.

### Polytopes

In segments of cities, you can find polytopes. Polytopes repair your hover. They can
be collected, but only once.
As we see, polytopes emit small cubes. What's the meaning behind this?

### Cubes

They seem to be remnants of a previous, highly advanced culture. They sound so beautiful
and peaciful if you - well, what do you do? Consume them? Do they consume you? Eventually,
it feels good to meet them.

And, there are purple cubes in the void area outside.

## People

### You

You are a nameless driver in a hover car that finds himself in a city.

### Agent 12

## Groups

This is your early buddy, your tutorial person. Someone that is introduced that
you know him.

### The Fishmongers

Introduced to be a household name, with sinister associations.
This now is a kind of a 7/11, a 24/7 convenience store. They are said to trade a 
lot more.

Actually, it's the fishmongers who built the void, a large space of virtual reality.
It was designed to built a peaceful place to rest from the real life. Because users 
felt lonely, they added other inhabitants to it, to feel more home.

Fishmongers created the retail shops to be part of the entire thing, to be able
to watch and supervise the entire creation.

Maybe find source code repos of the founders?
Mine Fishcoins?
Fight robots?

THe Fishmongers are a business established to become a daily part of everyone's life.
Later, we learn they are funded by suspicious business, involved with dubious political
fractions, to make everybody dependant on them, to evetually tear down the current 
government in a public revolution.
In the end we learn, this action is organized by the party of the current government,
which is funded by international governments and domestic heavy industries.




### someone

They started out by selling games to play if you are on the go. They are seriously
addictive, meeting the peoples' need for repetitive tasks and empty minds while
rushing to their works on uppers.

### Plent-o-matic (loanworking)

The mass employer advertising everywhere.

## Environment

We observe a day night cycle that never gets really bright.

### Food

Ramen is mentioned.

### Sprouce (Lemonade)

You see advertisement for a lemonade everywhere.
